I started by splitting into dumb components so that the parent can handle logic and state.
Refactored the components to have a reusable component.
Moved on to styling as in the figma file.
Moved on to fixing endpoint logic for prices and unit test.

If i had more time, i would implement stores in svelteKit, a database. Discount logic. Focused on front end to reflect figma to the best of my abilities. I would split backend logic into services so that the controller is clean. I would add front end tests and end to end tests. I would fix the failing unit test, but couldnt figure out the path issue at the moment. I would like to add swagger to document the endpoint.
